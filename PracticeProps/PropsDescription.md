Here are 20 tasks to help you practice Props in React Native:

Basic Prop Passing: Create a component that accepts a message prop and displays it inside a Text component.

Multiple Props: Create a component that accepts firstName and lastName as props and displays a full name using both.

Default Props: Create a component that has a default prop value, like a default message, when no prop is passed.

Props with Different Types: Create a component that accepts a number as a prop and displays it along with some text.

Boolean Prop: Create a component that accepts a showMessage prop (boolean). If true, it should display a message.

Prop Validation: Pass a prop with a specific type (e.g., string) and use PropTypes to enforce that type.

Array as Prop: Create a component that accepts an array of strings and displays each string inside a Text component.

Object as Prop: Create a component that accepts an object with name and age properties and displays them.

Conditional Rendering: Pass a boolean prop to a component that conditionally displays different content.

Function as Prop: Pass a function as a prop to a button component. The function should handle a button press and display a message.

Styling with Props: Pass a color prop to style the Text component dynamically.

Render Child Components: Pass a React component (as a prop) to another component and render it inside.

Array of Components: Pass an array of components as a prop and render each one in the parent component.

Component that Receives an Element Prop: Create a component that receives an element (e.g., a Button or Text) as a prop and displays it.

Number Prop with Default: Create a component that accepts a number prop for a counter and display it. If no number is passed, default it to 0.

Props with a Function and Parameters: Pass a function as a prop that takes a parameter and displays it in the child component when the function is called.

Updating Props Based on User Input: Create a parent component that has an input field, and pass the input value to a child component as a prop.

Nested Component with Prop: Create a nested component structure where a parent passes a prop to a child, and the child passes a modified prop to its child.

Callback Prop: Create a child component that accepts a callback function as a prop and calls it when a button is pressed.

Prop Drilling: Create a component hierarchy where a prop is passed down through multiple components and eventually displayed at the bottom.
